# 1. What is the difference between an if statement and a while loop?

# 2. How many times will the code inside this loop run:
 #  i = 0
  # while i < 3:
   #    i = i + 1

# 3. What is the purpose of the else part in an if statement?

# 4. What is a common mistake that can create an infinite loop?

 #  if x > 10:
   #    print("Big")
 #  elif x > 5:
 #      print("Medium")
 #  else:
    #   print("Small")

# 6. Why would you use continue inside a loop?

# 7. Describe a real-life situation that would fit using a while loop.

# 8. How would you write a condition that checks if a number is not between 10 and 20?

# 9. What does break do in a loop, and when would you use it?
