# Chapter 2 â€“ Flow Control

# 1. What is the difference between an if statement and a while loop?

# if statement is for condition to make sure, and while loop its range of int until reach desire condition

# 2. How many times will the code inside this loop run:
 #  i = 0
  # while i < 3:
   #    i = i + 1

# 3 times

# 3. What is the purpose of the else part in an if statement?

# to make sure if the condition matches to false desire it will display the result of false / true

# 4. What is a common mistake that can create an infinite loop?

# to not be sure until which range it should be

# 5. Explain what this block does:
 #  if x > 10:
   #    print("Big")
 #  elif x > 5:
 #      print("Medium")
 #  else:
    #   print("Small")

# if the x is bigger then 10 its will print big, if 5 prints medium and if it smaller then 5 it will display small

# 6. Why would you use continue inside a loop?

# when the desire condition reaches, gives command what to coutinue 

# 7. Describe a real-life situation that would fit using a while loop.

# if there wrong password and how much needed to do until the password gets block

# 8. How would you write a condition that checks if a number is not between 10 and 20?

# if number < 10 or number > 20

# 9. What does break do in a loop, and when would you use it?

# using it if needed to reach range and breaks of the loop to going on

# 10. What is the difference between and, or, and not?

# between is range of numbers , or its 1 or 2 , and not if it isn't true or false
