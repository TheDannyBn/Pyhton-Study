# Chapter 1 â€“ Python Basics

# 1. What is the difference between a variable and a value in Python?

# variable is a label used for storing data, value is actual data which stored inside of variable


# 2. Explain what happens in Python when you write: x = y = 5.

# it will be the same value because y is the first variable which assign

# 3. If a = 2 and b = '2', what happens when you try to add a + b?

# will raise a error, because there str and int

# 4. Predict the output of this code:
#   x = 5
#  x = x + 3
#  print(x)

# it will be 8 because x = 5 and marking there that another x its 5 + 3

# 5. What are some situations where indentation matters in Python?

# when making nested code

# 6. Why is Python called an 'interpreted' language, and how does it affect running your code?

# it execute line by line within the code, and don't run it self.

# 7. What will happen if you run code with this line: print("Hello)?

# will display error because there no double quotes

# 8. How does Python handle case sensitivity in variable names? (e.g., Var, var, and VAR)

# three examples marks diffrences because pyhton marks senentive with upper case and lower case

# 9. What is the difference between = and == in Python?

# = is assign , while == its marking if true or false

# 10. How can you figure out what type a variable holds, and why does it matter?

# can be used with using type() whithin the function
