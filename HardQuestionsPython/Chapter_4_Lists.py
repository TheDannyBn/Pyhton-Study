# Chapter 4 – Lists

# 1. What is the difference between a list and a string?

# list is array, string is sentence

# 2. What will be the result of this:
 #  myList = [1, 2, 3]
 #  print(myList[1])

# will print 2 cause the index starts in 0

# 3. How do you change the last item in a list without knowing how long it is?

# by typying -1 in the changes of array cause -1 targets last in the string

# 4. Can a list hold different types of values at once?

# yes it can

# 5. What happens if you try to access an index that doesn’t exist?

# will raise type error

# 6. Explain what append() does compared to insert().

# append adds at the end, while insert adds in specified position

# 7. What is slicing, and how would you get the first 3 items in a list?

# slicing is removing from list, and you can do like slice.[0,2]

# 8. If a list is copied using list2 = list1, and you change list2, does list1 change too? Why?

# because they both targets the same list, you can create copy of it like list2 = list1.copy()

# 9. What is the difference between sort() and sorted()? 

# range of numbers to be sorted, and sorted is all the list sorted by the small to the bigger

# 10. Can a list contain another list? How would you access an item inside it?

# yes, it is nested list and ccces is list[index_of_inner_list]
