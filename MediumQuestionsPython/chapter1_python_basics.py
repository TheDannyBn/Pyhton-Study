# Chapter 1 – Python Basics (Medium Level Questions)

# 1. What will be the result and type of the expression: 5 / 2 and 5 // 2?

# / is float // is int, float is number with dot, int and whole number.

# will get error system, by name error

# 4. Predict the output:

# x = x + 2
# print(x)

# it will be 5 cause x = 3 and adds more 2.

# 5. Describe a real-world example of when you would use a float instead of an integer.

# with bank account, to show whole cash and not as integer

# 6. Why is the following line incorrect?
# 3 = x

# cause 3 is int and you can't assign it as verible

# 7. What is the output of this expression and why?
# print("2" + "5")

# 2 and 5 will be 25 cause the double quotes 

# 8. How can you get user input and make sure it is treated as a number (not a string)?

# doing as int(input)

# 9. What will print(type(3.0)) and print(type(3)) return? Explain why.
